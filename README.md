# Vehicle-Speed-Detection-Using-CNN
In this project, we tried to achieve the following objectives.
1. To build a model and train it using a dataset that consists of almost 2400 images of cars in
roads.
2. To detect our desired object, a car, from a video feed collected from a traffic signal CCTV
footage. And then, to calculate the accuracy of the vehicle detection.
3. Measure speed from the movement of our detected object in the video feed as frames
change.
4. Compare our measured speed with actual speed of the vehicles in the traffic signal and
calculate the error.
5. Analyze the error and search for room for improvements in future work.
